"Lets build a MMORPG" series by RM2KDEV
youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/rm2kdev

Ryan, aka RM2KDEV, demonstrates a basic client/server architecture for an MMORPG
using NodeJS, MongoDB, and GameMaker

I'm going to follow along in the videos and make notes in the files relevant
to what he's saying in the video. Generalized notes will go in this file.
===========================================================================
With all of the dependencies set in package.json, open a terminal to the folder of your project and type "nmm install"

USE:

Feel free to clone this repo if you want.
It'll probably mean more if you follow along with the videos from
scratch and write it out yourself, though. (might stick?)
 
I've turned on 'collaborators only' on contributions because it's really
meant to just be a place for me to back up my code while I'm following
along with the videos.
